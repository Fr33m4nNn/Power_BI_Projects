![Dashboard](../images/P2/1_Dashboard.gif)

## 🏆 Introduction

This interactive Power BI dashboard was built to explore over a century of Nobel Prize awards, offering insights into winners, affiliated universities, countries, and prize values (both original and adjusted for today).

The dashboard provides dynamic filtering and parameter-driven views, enabling users to:

-   Analyze median Nobel Prize values across different categories, both historical and adjusted for today.
-   Compare awards distribution by category, continent, gender, and individual vs. organization.
-   Explore university affiliations, including prize values and the number of Nobel Laureates tied to each institution.
-   Track the trend of Nobel Prizes awarded over time with yearly breakdowns.

This project was part of my Power BI practice journey, designed to strengthen skills in interactive dashboarding, advanced measures, and parameter usage while telling the story of one of the world’s most prestigious awards.
