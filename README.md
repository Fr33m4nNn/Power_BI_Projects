# Water Pollution Dashboard w/ Power BI

FIRST GIF ---------------------------

## 🌊 Introduction

This water pollution dashboard was created to explore environmental and water quality conditions across 10 countries using key indicators such as contaminant levels, access to clean water, sanitation level and urbanization rates.

The dashboard allows users to filter by year, country, and contaminant type to view trends and compare water quality metrics across different water sources.

This project was part of my Power BI learning journey, where I practiced building dynamic and interactive dashboards using real-world dataset simulations and advanced Power BI features.

🔗 Data Source: [Water Pollution and Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/water-pollution-and-disease/data)

⚠️ Disclaimer: The dataset used in this project contains simulated values and does not represent actual real-world statistics. All results and insights are for demonstration and learning purposes only.

## Skills Showcased

This project was a journey through key Power BI features. Here's a look at what we mastered:

-   **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **🧮 Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Healthcare Access` and `GDP per Capita`.
-   **📊 Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare contamination rates and track trends over time.
-   **🔢 KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
-   **🎨 Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-   **🖱️ Interactive Reporting:**
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.

## Dashboard Overview

*This report is split into two distinct pages to provide both a high-level summary and a detailed analysis.*
