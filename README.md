# Water Pollution Dashboard w/ Power BI

## ðŸŒŠ Introduction

This water pollution dashboard was created to explore environmental and water quality conditions across 10 countries using key indicators such as contaminant levels, access to clean water, and urbanization rates.

The dashboard allows users to filter by year, country, and contaminant type to view trends and compare water quality metrics across different water sources. It also highlights the most commonly used water treatment methods in each context.

This project was part of my Excel learning journey, where I practiced building dynamic and interactive dashboards using real-world datasets and advanced Excel features.
