# Water Pollution Dashboard w/ Power BI

![Dashboard](images/1_Dashboard.gif)

## 🌊 Introduction

This interactive Power BI dashboard was created to explore environmental and water quality conditions across 10 countries using a variety of indicators such as contaminant levels, access to clean water, sanitation coverage, healthcare access, and urbanization rates.

The dashboard provides dynamic filtering and drill-through features, enabling users to:

-   Track access to clean water and healthcare over time.
-   Compare contamination levels, sanitation coverage, and population density across countries.
-   View detailed country-level breakdowns of water quality metrics (e.g., pH, turbidity, lead, nitrate, bacteria).
-   Explore disease-related trends such as typhoid, cholera, and infant mortality rates.

This project was part of my Power BI learning journey, where I practiced building professional, interactive dashboards to analyze complex datasets and present insights clearly.

## Skills Showcased

This project was a journey through key Power BI features. Here's a look at what we mastered:

-   **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **🧮 Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Healthcare Access` and `GDP per Capita`.
-   **📊 Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare contamination rates and track trends over time.
-   **🔢 KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
-   **🎨 Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-   **🖱️ Interactive Reporting:**
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.

## Dashboard Overview

*This report is split into two distinct pages to provide both a high-level summary and a detailed analysis.*

### Page 1: High-Level Environmental View

![Page 1](images/2_1_Page_1.gif)

This page provides an overview of water quality and related socio-economic conditions across 10 countries. It highlights key indicators such as GDP per capita, sanitation coverage, healthcare access, and urbanization rates. Users can explore trends in access to clean water, compare contamination levels, and analyze the relationship between population density and healthcare access. Together, these visuals give a quick snapshot of how environmental and public health factors interact at a global scale.

## Conclusion

This dashboard demonstrates how Power BI can be used to track and analyze water pollution trends across regions, highlighting key indicators such as contamination levels, seasonal patterns, and potential areas of concern. While the dataset used here is simulated for demonstration purposes, the same approach can be applied to real-world data to support monitoring, decision-making, and policy development
