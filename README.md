# Water Pollution Dashboard w/ Power BI

FIRST GIF ---------------------------

## 🌊 Introduction

This interactive Power BI dashboard was created to explore environmental and water quality conditions across 10 countries using a variety of indicators such as contaminant levels, access to clean water, sanitation coverage, healthcare access, and urbanization rates.

The dashboard provides dynamic filtering and drill-through features, enabling users to:

-   Track access to clean water and healthcare over time.
-   Compare contamination levels, sanitation coverage, and population density across countries.
-   View detailed country-level breakdowns of water quality metrics (e.g., pH, turbidity, lead, nitrate, bacteria).
-   Explore disease-related trends such as typhoid, cholera, and infant mortality rates.

This project was part of my Power BI learning journey, where I practiced building professional, interactive dashboards to analyze complex datasets and present insights clearly.

## Skills Showcased

This project was a journey through key Power BI features. Here's a look at what we mastered:

-   **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **🧮 Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Healthcare Access` and `GDP per Capita`.
-   **📊 Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare contamination rates and track trends over time.
-   **🔢 KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
-   **🎨 Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-   **🖱️ Interactive Reporting:**
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.

## Dashboard Overview

*This report is split into two distinct pages to provide both a high-level summary and a detailed analysis.*
